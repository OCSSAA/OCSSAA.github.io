Schedule and Rankings
After the Christmas break I will ask teams to rank themselves,  and create a schedule based on last year’s results and this year’s evaluations.

Accommodations for this year’s tournament
As mentioned our traditional sites in Belleville are full.   They will know of available rooms at the end of December if you want to book at the Fairfield Inne and Suites.  However, Marc Garneau is the location for our games, and is found in Trenton.  These hotels are closer to the facilities and cheaper!
